# Steam-Bot-Hours-
This Script will allow you to run steam games without actually playing them or having them installed. so you are able to use it to idle up to 32 games at once to boost hours. This is my first Bot i have made using node-steam-user and my first ever git+hub post.

To use this bit just add your username and password on lines 5 and 6 as the comments explains.
Also you will need to get the AppID for the games you want to idle and add them to line 12 as the comment says.
Once you have done that run the install file and wait for it to close itself. once it has closed run the RunSteamHoursBot file to start idling(you will need to enter in auth code). if everYthing is working you should see a message saying "succesfully logged on and playing".
