# Steam Hours Bot
This Script will allow you to run steam games without actually playing them or having them installed. so you are able to use it to idle up to 32 games at once to boost hours. This is my first Bot i have made using node-steam-user and my first ever git+hub post.

# How to install
### 1. Install Node.js
[Click here to install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
### 2. Download the Steam-Bot-Hours
[Click here to download Steam-Bot-Hours](https://github.com/goodjonte/Steam-Bot-Hours/archive/master.zip)
### 3. Install nodes
Run install_1 and install_2
### 4. Start bot
Open file RunSteamBot (Use this file in future to run bot) to start using bot and login to begin idling, when bot is working you should see the message "Succesfully logged on and playing"
