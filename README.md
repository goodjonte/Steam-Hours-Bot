# Steam-Bot-Hours-
This Script will allow you to run steam games without actually playing them or having them installed. so you are able to use it to idle up to 32 games at once to boost hours. This is my first Bot i have made using node-steam-user.

To use this bit just add your username and password on lines 5 and 6 as the comments explains.
Also you will need to get the AppID for the games you want to idle and add them to line 12 as the comment says.
